## DragTrack - A Kanban Board for Drag and Drop

DragTrack is a simple Kanban board that allows you to drag and drop tasks between columns. It is built using:

- React
- DnD-Kit
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer-Motion
- Lucide Icons (for the icons)

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Drag and drop containers.
- Delete containers and items.
- Edit container and item names.
- Drag and drop items between containers.
- Add containers and items (both are draggable).
- Indication of which container you are editing items in.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by implementing the functionality for creating containers. Next, I added the ability to drag and drop containers. Afterwards, I focused on the capability to create items inside containers and further, to drag and drop them. Then I styled the board, drawing inspiration from modern Kanban boards like Jira, Trello, and Notion based on my experience. Subsequently, I added functionalities for deleting items and containers. I then implemented the ability to edit the names of containers and items. Lastly, I added an indication of which container you are editing items in. Afterward, I performed some small refactoring and styling touch-ups. Some features were added in between the main features development.

**NOTE:** Pruspose of th eproject is to demonstrate the use of DnD-Kit and TypeScript. The project is not meant to be a full-fledged Kanban board.
